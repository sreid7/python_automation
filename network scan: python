--Python Network Scan Using NMAP--
TCP scan (lower privileges)

__Installations that need to be made__
Kali Linux commands
1. sudo apt-get install ufw 
    (to check the firewall status)
    sudo ufw status (kali linux command)
Status: inactive (resulting in no active firewall blockage)
Status: active (resulting in an active firewall blockage and further investigation is needed)
__Another way to remediate this is to add the -Pn option within the python nmap script in order to ignore the online status of the target.__

***CODE STARTS HERE***
