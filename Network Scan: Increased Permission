**Increase in privilege: Allowing ICMP to and from**

--First use // sudo ufw enable // enter machine password: Message: Firewall is active and enabled on system startup
--sudo ufw allow from (PLACE ATTACKERS IP ADDRESS HERE) to any /// (Allowing ICMP traffic from the IP address of the attacker)

--ping -c 4 (PLACE TARGET"S IP ADDRESS HERE) (This command is to test the ICMP connection by sending 4 ICMP echo requests to the target machine).

**BEST WAY TO GAIN ACCESS TO ANY SYSTEM WITH CREDENTIALED PERMISSIONS WOULD BE TO USE SSH. After that a proper scan can take place.**
